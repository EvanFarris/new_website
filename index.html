		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I am a fourth-year student at Illinois Tech. I am aiming to get a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science through Illinois Tech's co-terminal program. I am expected to graduate May/June 2021, and hope to join the workforce soon after that. I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, and for the past year, I have resided in Hyde Park.</p>

		<h2>Interests</h2>
		<p class="para">Now you may or may not be interested in what I do outside of my resume, but hopefully this will shed some light on what I do outside the classroom.</p>
		
		<h3>Coding</h3>
		<p class="para">This is a given. Without this interest, I wouldn't be continuing to pursue my degree. I love being able to create something that could benefit myself, or others. I love how challenging it can be, and I love the problem solving aspect. There is this sense of unbridled joy and accomplishment once you solve a bug that has been plaguing your code for hours.</p>
		
		<h3>Video Games</h3>
		<p class="para">While this may seem unprofessional, most of my time goes to playing video games. To some, it may be childish, or a waste of time, but to me, its a lot more.</p>
		<p class="para">To me, video games is art, it's a story, it's strategic, it's exercise, it's competitive. It can be anything, and everything.</p>
